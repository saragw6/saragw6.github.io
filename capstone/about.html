            <h1>Defining LGBTQ+ Terms</h1>
            <p>I'm a senior studying Gender and Sexuality, and as my capstone project I'm going to be creating a website that defines terms having to do with gender and sexuality.</p>
            <p>I often get questions about what certain words mean or what words a person can use to describe themselves. There's some good LGBTQ vocab lists out there, but I'm trying to define words that aren't always found on those lists. Also, I want to include personal descriptions of what a word means to various people, not a sterilized dictionary definition. </p>
            <p> These words have a lot of nuance and depth and they mean something different to each person. For example, two people who idenify as bisexual might have completely different explanations of what that word means to them. I want to include more than one perspective so people learning these words can get more of the full story, and if they're looking for a way to label themself they can find something they connect to.</p>

            <p>This site is partially for people who are questioning their gender or sexual identity and want to know more about what words they could use to describe themselves. It's also for allies who are looking to know more about LGBTQ+ terms. There are so many words used to describe gender and orientation, and it can be super freeing to have so many to choose from, but it can also make it trickier for people who aren't familiar with all the language yet. The aim of this project is to help people navigate the dozens and dozens of terms out there, whether they are looking to understand themselves or others better.</p>
