Successes and Failures
----------------------

The redirect from my cs.tufts page was implimented correctly, as were my
index.html and bio.html pages. My resume.html page was overall successful,
although I was (so far) unable to find a solution to an error concerning <ul>
in the nested list in my resume. The rendering of the page looks as I intended,
but the HTML validator flags it as an error.
