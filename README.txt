Successes and Failures
----------------------

The redirect from my cs.tufts page was implimented correctly, as were my
index.html and bio.html pages. My resume.html page was successful in the end.
Although I was temporarily  unable to find a solution to an error concerning
<ul> in the nested list in my resume, I was able to solve the problem quickly
when I came back to it with fresh eyes.
